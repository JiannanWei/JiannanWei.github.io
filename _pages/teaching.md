Teaching Philosophy
======
High-quality teaching can be challenging and gratifying, and I am committed to meet this challenge to help
students succeed in their studies. My major strengths in teaching include:
1. A thorough understanding of the course materials, and a broad and solid background in the related subjects;
2. Extensive industry experience in the fields of software design and development, and information security and forensics;
3. A well prepared and organized presentation which include a brief review at the start and a brief summary at the end of each lecture;
4. The use of comprehensive examples as a guide for students to apply the theory and aid in the improvement of their problem solving ability;
5. Effective communication with students during and after lectures in order to resolve any problems;
6. A showing of enthusiasm towards teaching and genuine interest in course subjects which motivate students to learn.

Also, I actively use Information technology (IT) in my classes. For example, I include interactive teaching through the use of virtualization technology. When I introduce some cyber attacking scenarios in my class, I not only illustrate the theory but also set up some vulnerable systems that will be used as in-class live test systems in order to understand how these attacking techniques work. It motivates and helps students master the information security skills required to ensure success in their future career field. Furthermore, I have designed and developed aseries of laboratory assignments and analytical exercises to help students gain practical skills in information security and forensics. All the efforts that I have made in teaching have significantly improved my teaching quality and efficiency

Supervision of Students
======
As to the student supervision, my goal is to guide the students toward creative thinking and independent research, to motivate and help them learn, to provide detailed research directions and steps whenever necessary, and finally, to improve their communications skills.
