I am working at [Nanjing University of Science and Technology](https://www.njust.edu.cn/) in China as an associate professor in cyber security. I am a Member of IEEE and currently serve as an reviewer for several top academic conferences and journals in cyber security, AI security and Internet of Things privacy, e.g., *IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics*, *IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications*, *IEEE Internet of Things Journal*, *Computers & Security*, *The Computer Journal*, *IJCM*, *WPC*, *IEEE WoWMoM* and *TrustCom*.

My current research interests are Cyber Security, AI security, Cloud Computing, Internet of Things Privacy, Blockchain and Post-quantum cryptography (PQC) (i.e., secure PQC algorithms against quantum attacks). I received my M.Sc degree from the University of Zhengzhou of China (ZZU) in 2012 and a Ph.D degree from the [University of Wollongong](https://www.uow.edu.au/), Australia, in 2016.
