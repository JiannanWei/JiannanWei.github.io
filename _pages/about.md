I am working at [Nanjing University of Science and Technology](https://www.njust.edu.cn/) in China as an associate professor in cybersecurity. I am a Member of IEEE and currently serve as a reviewer for several top academic conferences and journals in cybersecurity, AI security and Internet of Things privacy, e.g., *IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics*, *IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications*, *IEEE Internet of Things Journal*, *Computers & Security*, *The Computer Journal*, *IJCM*, *WPC*, *IEEE WoWMoM* and *TrustCom*.

My current research interests are Cybersecurity, AI security, Cloud Computing, Internet of Things Privacy, Blockchain and Post-quantum Cryptography (PQC) (i.e., secure PQC algorithms against quantum attacks). I received my M.Sc. degree from Zhengzhou University of China (ZZU) in 2012 and a Ph.D. degree from the [University of Wollongong](https://www.uow.edu.au/), Australia, in 2016.
